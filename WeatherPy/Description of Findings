1. There is a strong negative correlation (-0.8) between latitude and temperature in the northern hemisphere. As latitude increases, temperature decreases. 
2. There is a positive correlation (0.55) between latitude and temperature in the southern hemisphere. 
  While not as strong as the negative correlation between the two variables in the northern hemisphrere, a correlary relationship is still evident. 
3. There is no correlation between latitude and wind speed in the northern hemisphere. 
  However, in the southern hemisphere, there is a very weak negative correlation (-0.2) between latitude and wind speed.
